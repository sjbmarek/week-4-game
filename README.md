1. How the app works:

   * There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, the player's score counter updates.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

   * Player wins and loses are logged.

2. Tech features:

   * Javascript
